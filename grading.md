# Grading

This project will be worth **15%** of your semester total grade. It will be scored on a basis of **100 points**, scaled accordingly when entered in the gradebook.

The points distribution is divided into two distinctions: **required** and **optional** tasks.  
- **Required tasks** will account for up to **30 points**.  
- **Optional tasks** will account for up to **45 points**.  
- Up to **5 points** may transfer from the optional to the required category to make up for lost points.

The maximum number of points a team can receive from just the optional and required tasks is **70 points** out of the total 100 points possible.

The final **30 points** can be earned through **“wow factors.”** While grading your projects, I want to see creative and expressive use of the skills we’ve learned this semester.  
- One ‘wow factor’ that’s impressive enough could equate to a full 30 points.  
- Alternatively, a submission may have three or four wow factors that together earn 25 points.

The key to maximizing wow factor points is **creativity and vision** for the site.

> **Note:** No student will receive more than 100% on the project.
